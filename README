findscreen searches a video or group of videos for a certain screen

output format is <video path>:<I-frame number>:<timestamp>:<difference factor>
the lower the difference factor, the more closely the screen resembles that
particular I-frame

takeshot reads output generated by findscreen and takes a screenshot at that
point in the video for validation purposes

choptitle reads output generated by findscreen and removes a portion of video
starting at <timestamp> and ending at <timestamp> + <length> which is passed
as a parameter to choptitle
